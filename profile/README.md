# HXCKR

Welcome to Hxckr, a Bitcoin Learning Hub. Hxckr is a self-paced technical learning platform designed to help developers of all levels get hands-on experience with Bitcoin and Lightning development. 
Our open-source curriculum includes real-world coding challenges, curated projects, and comprehensive guides to help you navigate the world of Bitcoin development.

## About the Platform
Hxckr is built to provide a seamless learning experience with a focus on practical coding exercises. Through a series of well-structured lessons, students will start from the basics and progressively build more complex projects, 
applying core Bitcoin development concepts.

Our courses are divided into several modules, each with exercises that follow a project-based approach. Throughout each course, students will build a working project and gain the necessary skills to develop and build the contents of the course independently.

## Key Features
1. Comprehensive Courses: Covering Bitcoin and Lightning development, including transaction parsing, wallet building, and more.
2. Hands-on Projects: Every course offers real-world tasks and challenges that encourage learners to build useful, functional applications.
3. Automated Code Assessment: Our platform includes a fully automated code assessment system that evaluates your code submissions and provides instant feedback.
4. Self-paced Learning: Learn at your own pace with structured lessons that build on each other.
5. Free Open Source: All repositories are public, and contributions from the community are welcome!
